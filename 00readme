# Halloween Monster for Raspberry Pi

Interactive Halloween prop that detects trick-or-treaters and talks to them using AI.

Just a play project using copilot, some AI integration and voice generation.

Intended to work with a cheap ultrasonic sensor - mines not working very well(1601).

Have fun.

## What it does

- Detects people with ultrasonic sensor
- Plays spooky music through 3.5mm jack
- Talks with AI-generated responses (Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
- Listens and responds to what people say
- Changes voices randomly to keep it creepy
- Gets more aggressive when people try to leave

## Hardware needed

- Raspberry Pi (tested on RPi 3B)
- US-100 or RCWL-1601 ultrasonic sensor
- USB microphone
- Powered speaker on 3.5mm jack
- Jumper wires for GPIO

## Quick start

1. Wire sensor to GPIO pins 17 (trigger) and 27 (echo)
2. System deps (may not be complete)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    python3-pip \
    python3-dev \
    python3-rpi.gpio \
    espeak \
    portaudio19-dev \
    alsa-utils \
    sox \
    libatlas-base-dev \
    python3-pygame \
    pigpiod
3. Install dependencies (use a venv): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up API keys in keyring or export as env vars
5. Run: `python halloween_detect_sensor.py`

Check the `dev` file for example environment setup.

## Notes

- Needs root for GPIO access on Pi
- Works with or without microphone (display-only mode)
- Falls back to espeak if ElevenLabs quota runs out
- Logs to `dev/monster.log` by default

Have fun scaring the kidZ!
